# Spotify to ï£¿ Music Converter
------
Import your Spotify Playlists to Apple Music!

## Cool! How do I use this though?

1. Get a Mac, this won't run on Windows
2. Download [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) and open it once to install all it's shit stuff
3. Download this repo as a `.zip` or clone it in git and open up the Xcode project, connect your phone, select your **developer account** for signing and hit Run.
10. This will install the app onto your phone, press the humongous ***"GO"*** button, log in and select the playlist you want to sync
11. ???
12. Profit

## But why?
Some people like me wanted to switch from Spotify to Apple Music, but didn't want to lose all their playlists, so here ya go

## Can I use that?
I don't know if you can, but you may, this project is licensed [MIT](LICENSE), so you can even redistribute it, as long as you mention me somehow.
